## FOLLOWING (AI) PIECE
<div id="status"><a href="javascript:getLocation();">Generate next location</a></div>  

AI often uses data from a large group of people to learn how to behave. 

The specifics of those people&mdash;who they are, their individual experiences, their collective biases&mdash;are obscured. An AI seems like a "black box" without a body, and gives the impression that its intelligence is spontaneous, rather than enculturated.

But the uncanniness of an AI is not that it acts _as if_ it were human, but that it _is_ human, a chimera of human parts whose whole we almost recognize but can't quite place.

In [Following Piece](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/283737) (1969), Vito Acconci followed random strangers around New York. He was attempting, maybe, to relinguish his own agency in favor of the latent logics of public space.

I'm going to do the same, but i'm going to follow 606 people at once. They are anonymous volunteers who installed tracking software on their phones, enabling me to log a GPS point whenever any of them move further than 100ft over the last three years.
